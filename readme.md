# 🧠 Palantir – My AI & Machine Learning Learning Journal

Welcome to **Palantir**, my personal Jupyter notebook where I document everything I learn, build, and experiment with in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**.  
This isn’t just code — it’s my ongoing journey of understanding how machines learn, reason, and make decisions.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This notebook serves as a **living document** of my growth in AI/ML — a place to:
- Practice coding concepts from scratch  
- Write down explanations and theory in my own words  
- Build small models and visualize how they work  
- Track progress as I move from beginner → practitioner → builder  

Every experiment, every note, and every block of code here is a step forward.

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries

I’m building everything in **Python**, using the core ecosystem of data science tools:

- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**
- 🔢 **NumPy** – numerical computation  
- 🧮 **Pandas** – data manipulation & preprocessing  
- 📊 **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization  
- 🧠 **Scikit-Learn** – ML models & utilities  
- 🤖 (Planned) TensorFlow / PyTorch – deep learning frameworks
