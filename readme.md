# 🧠 **Palantir – My AI & Machine Learning Learning Journal**

> *“Palantir isn’t just a notebook — it’s my mirror, reflecting how far I’ve come and how far I still want to go.”*

---

Welcome to **Palantir**, my personal **Jupyter notebook** documenting everything I learn, build, and experiment with in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**.  

This isn’t just code — it’s a living notebook of my journey into how machines **learn**, **reason**, and **make decisions**.

---

## 🚀 **Purpose**

This repository serves as a **living document** of my growth in AI/ML — a space to:

- 🧩 Practice coding concepts from scratch  
- 🧠 Write down explanations and theory in my own words  
- 🧪 Build small models and visualize how they work  
- 📈 Track my progress from *beginner → practitioner → builder*

> Every experiment, every note, and every block of code here is a step forward.
